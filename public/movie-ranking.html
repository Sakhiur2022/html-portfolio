<h1>The Best Animes According to Sakhiur</h1>
<h2>My top 3 animes of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Ninja Kamui</h3>
<p>I loved the fighting animations of this anime so much.
    Specially the fight scene of the first episode. Also, it has a great plot
    and no unnecessary stories.

<h3>Tokyo Ghoul</h3>
<h3>Parasite</h3>
